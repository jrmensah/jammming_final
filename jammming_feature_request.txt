OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to have the user search for songs, using search features with keyboard

BACKGROUND 
Jammming app search function is triggered by user that clicks on the search button. To minimize frictions 
and make it easier and faster for users to retrieve results, search by “Enter” keyboard button should be
implemented. Users should not have to switch between keyboard and mouse to make a search

TECHNICAL DESIGN
To implement this function, we should add a new method to the SearchBar component by creating a new method 
called “enterSearch” that accepts an argument “e”. Within the enterSearch method, a condition should check 
for e.keyCode === 13. Where keyCode 13 is the return or enter keycode. If true, call this.search() that will
initialize spotify search. Next step is to bind this method in the constructor with: this.enterSearch = this.enterSearch.bind(this);
And then we need to assign this method to an event handler in the render method of SearchBar combonent.

CAVEATS
If our app grows, we need to ensure that no other components are assigned the same keycode.
